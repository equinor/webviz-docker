# Build webviz docker image

This repository is building and deploying a `webviz` Docker base image
to the [webviz Dockerhub repository](https://hub.docker.com/u/webviz).

Every time a new tag is released in this repository, the base image on
Dockerhub will be updated, which then can be used by `webviz-config`.

This repository is in alpha.
